## Prompt 1
### Successfully built structure of web app and called apis, made small protocol mistake causing weather to not load
Assume you are an undergraduate IT student, tasked with making a simple 1-page web app for learning the basics of AJAX inside a framework of HTML/CSS/JS. This is a serverless application, so assume the client-side page makes all calls. The specifications for this app are:

- integrates a weather api with geolocator-specific data
- integrates another api of your choosing
- follows basic UI / UX principles
- all CSS / HTML must validate

This is a very simple app, however should look put-together. There does not need to be a link between the weather api and the second api. The purpose of the app is up to you. Assume an IA of 

\root
------index.html
------\resources
------------------style.css
------------------script.js

## Prompt 2
### fixed protocol issue, app now successfully loads info

your weather shows 'unable to retrieve your weather location' which suggests the error callback function for the geolocator method was called. please revise your js


## Prompt 3
### Added reactivity and creative ideas to the app successfully on the first try. Everything validates

Everything is working. now time for step 2.

Specifications:
- Give the application a creative name, with an image next to the title
- modify the css so the weather's background color is relevant to the weather
- modify the css so the joke's background is relevant to the joke (can be a constant color or a random color)
- add another div with an inspirational message and a relevant background color underneath the joke

## Prompt 4
### added a small weather icon. all images have alt text, and everything still validates

now include a small image that corresponds to the weather.
