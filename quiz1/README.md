# README for web sys quiz 1

## Things I learned during this quiz:
During this quiz I reinforced concepts in data fetching, css styling, and html semantics.

## Decisions I made during this quiz:
I chose to make an italian-themed menu because of my italian culture and significant familial value. These dishes represent several meals I ate daily for years, and hold special meaning in my heart.

My HTML structure was built on semantically-informed design decisions. I tried to use divs only when I needed to reorganize a grouping of other data, and instead opted to incorporate the section / article semantic structure. 

An article represents a group of replicable information, and a section represents a collection of replicable information. In my menu, things you could order were articles and their part of the menu (entre, app, drink, etc) felt right to be a section.

All images were pulled from the internet, and the JSON adds only a few extra lines to aide in inserting the html.

## Observations I want known about this quiz:
I suck at frontend :(((
